Prototype: void _print_rev_recursion(char *s);

2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange
mandatory

Prototype: int _strlen_recursion(char *s);

 You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling
mandatory

. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate
mandatory
Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

An empty string is a palindrome

Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...
#advanced
Write a function that compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.

Prototype: int wildcmp(char *s1, char *s2);
